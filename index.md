## CWRU CSDS-338, Operating Systems Fall 2024
<br>

Hi! I am Jiana, please call me Jia, one of your TA's for CSDS 338. I am a Junior studying Computer Science and Maths. I will lead/teach some of the Wednesday labs, and my office hours will be on -- in --. Drop by at any time!

I've put together some notes in this repository to help you out and will use these during Labs. I will update this as the semester goes on to ensure I go over concepts taught in class the previous week. These notes mostly review what we go over in class and will give you a solid foundation in Linux and C for your assignments. **It is not a sole compilation of everything taught in class** - i.e do not solely use this to learn, it is meant to refer to not a comprehensice book or so. If there's something specific you want to dive into during labs, just swing by my office hours. If enough people are interested, I'm happy to cover it in lab sessions too.

> **Important:**
> I know Operating Systems can seem pretty intimidating, but trust me—if you give it enough time and effort, it can be super interesting! Plus, knowing your way around OS is a huge asset in both corporate jobs and research. So, don't brush it off; it’s a valuable skill to have.

My main goal is to make this class enjoyable for you. Since this is my first time teaching, I really want your feedback. Shoot me an email if you have any suggestions on how I can improve my teaching style.

## Some Tips:

- **Attend lectures and labs:** Even if you feel like you study better alone, attending can help you grasp concepts better and keep you up to date with the content instead of cramming before tests.
  
- **Use ChatGPT wisely:** Sure, you could put assignments into ChatGPT or another AI, but besides the risk of getting caught, you won't learn or develop any useful skills. Instead, use ChatGPT to help you understand topics. I kept a chat pinned for OS help where I could ask questions and review notes. Just remember to cross-check because ChatGPT can be wrong.
  
- **Leverage YouTube:** Visual aids and diagrams can be really helpful. There are great YouTube videos out there, but don't just binge-watch entire playlists like Neso Academy’s Operating Systems. They might cover extra stuff we don’t, and miss things we do.
  
- **Understand the concepts:** If something isn’t clear, come to Office Hours, ask questions, **be curious**. Professor loves giving critical thinking questions on midterms that apply your knowledge to real-life contexts, which is a very useful skill.

I'll probably add more tips as the semester goes on. You've got this, and I can't wait to help you explore the awesome world of Operating Systems!

> ##### Please do come to labs, I will be sad teaching an empty class :'(
